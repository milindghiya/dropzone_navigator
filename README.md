# 📦 Dropzone Navigator

**Dropzone Navigator** is a cross-platform desktop application built with Electron that provides a user-friendly, tree-like file system interface for browsing and uploading files to Amazon S3 buckets through access points. It's designed for users who need secure, restricted access to specific S3 locations with an intuitive file manager experience.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 **Secure S3 Access**
- Connect using AWS Access Keys and S3 Access Point ARNs
- Automatic prefix-based access control (users can only access their designated folders)
- Support for folder-specific access points (e.g., `accesspoint/user123-documents`)
- Credentials are securely stored locally and can be remembered between sessions

### 🌳 **Tree-like File Navigation**
- Intuitive folder structure browsing similar to desktop file managers
- Breadcrumb navigation for easy path tracking and quick navigation
- Click folders to expand and explore nested directories
- Visual distinction between folders (📁) and files (📄)
- Prevents navigation above user's permitted access level

### 📤 **File Upload with Progress Tracking**
- Upload multiple files simultaneously to current folder location
- Real-time upload progress with file-by-file tracking
- Visual progress bar and status updates
- Automatic folder refresh after successful uploads
- Support for all file types with proper MIME type detection

### 💾 **Credential Management**
- Save credentials locally for convenience
- One-click credential clearing for security
- Auto-fill forms with saved credentials
- No sensitive data stored in recoverable format

### 🎨 **Modern UI/UX**
- Clean, responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Professional color scheme with hover effects and smooth transitions
- Loading states and error handling with clear user feedback
- Status bar with real-time operation updates

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Electron (Node.js)
- **AWS Integration**: AWS SDK v3 for JavaScript
- **Storage**: Local browser storage for credential persistence
- **Security**: Context isolation, disabled node integration, secure IPC communication

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### First-Time Setup
1. **Launch the Application**
2. **Enter AWS Credentials**:
   - Access Key ID
   - Secret Access Key
   - S3 Access Point ARN (e.g., `arn:aws:s3:us-east-1:123456789012:accesspoint/user123`)
3. **Click "Connect to S3"**
4. **Start browsing your files!**

### Navigation
- **Browse Folders**: Click any folder icon (📁) to open it
- **Navigate Back**: Use the breadcrumb trail at the top
- **Upload Files**: Click the "📁 Upload Files" button in the top-right corner
- **Clear Credentials**: Use the "Clear Saved" button to remove stored credentials

### Upload Process
1. Navigate to the desired folder
2. Click "📁 Upload Files"
3. Select one or multiple files
4. Watch the progress bar as files upload
5. Files will appear in the current folder once upload completes

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root for development:
```env
NODE_ENV=development
```

### AWS Configuration
The application requires:
- **Region**: Defaults to `us-east-1` (currently not configurable via UI)
- **Access Point ARN**: Must follow format `arn:aws:s3:region:account:accesspoint/name`
- **Permissions**: Minimum `s3:ListObjects` and `s3:PutObject` for the specified access point

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Failed**
- Verify AWS credentials are correct
- Check Access Point ARN format
- Ensure proper S3 permissions are granted
- Verify network connectivity

**Upload Fails** 
- Check file permissions on local system
- Verify S3 PutObject permissions
- Ensure sufficient storage quota
- Check file size limits

**Application Won't Start**
- Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
- Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
